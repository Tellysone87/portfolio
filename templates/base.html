            <p>Hello, my name is Shantel. I am thrilled to be a part of the computer engineering community.
                I started my career in the medical field and Transitioned into IT out of curiosity.
                I learned about a Java bootcamp provided by UST Global and decided to apply. I was accepted and that is
                how
                my journey started.</p>
            <p>Today I continue to grow as a developer. I recently graduated a software engineering bootcamp at
                HackBright
                Academy. I learned full stack web development and other computer science concepts.
                Before that, I attended a Data Analysis Bootcamp at Correlation One.
                Prior to that, I attended Macomb community college and received an associate degree in Associate of
                Applied
                Science and graduated with Magna Cum Laude honors.</p>

            <p>I enjoy coding and seeing the outcome of my applications. My tech stack includes Python, C#, JavaScript,
                Html, CSS and more. I invite you to check out my portfolio and projects.</p>
